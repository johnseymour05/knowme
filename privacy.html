Privacy Policy for You Think You Know Me

Effective date: August 12, 2025Developer/Publisher: John Seymour ("we", "us", or "our")

This Privacy Policy describes how You Think You Know Me (the "App") handles information when you use it. We are committed to protecting your privacy.

1) What the App Collects

No account and no personal profile: The App does not require you to create an account or provide personal details such as your name, email address, or phone number.

On‑device content: Game content (e.g., questions, prompts, favorites) and your selections remain on your device and are not transmitted to our servers.

Analytics / tracking: We do not use third‑party advertising SDKs or cross‑app tracking. If, in the future, we add privacy‑friendly analytics strictly to improve the App, we will update this policy first.

2) In‑App Purchases (StoreKit)

Purchases are processed by Apple via StoreKit. We do not receive your payment details. Apple may process limited transaction‑related data to complete your purchase.

We use StoreKit’s verified transactions to unlock Pro features. This entitlement check runs on‑device.

3) Data Sharing

We do not sell or rent your personal information.

We do not share information with advertisers or data brokers.

We may share information if required by law (e.g., to comply with a valid legal process).

4) Data Storage & Security

The App’s state and preferences are stored locally on your device. We do not operate a backend database for this App.

Apple’s platform controls (e.g., device encryption, App Store distribution) provide baseline security for the App.

5) Children’s Privacy

The App is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe a child provided personal information, please contact us and we will delete it.

6) Your Choices

You can delete the App at any time to remove locally stored data from your device.

If your device is shared, consider using device‑level privacy settings (Screen Time, passcode) to limit access.

7) Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will revise the “Effective date” above. Material changes will be highlighted in the App description or within the App where appropriate.
